## 2026-08-08 09:39 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: execute phase 3 of `.journal/002/PLAN.md` — the full
retry policy from the design's Defaults table (4 attempts, exponential backoff
with 1 s base / 30 s cap / full jitter, `Retry-After` honored, retry on network
errors/429/5xx, fail fast on other 4xx), applied per part.

Current state of the world: phases 1–2 are complete and proven. Master is at
796d477 with a clean tree. The core library pushes/pulls end to end against zot
(e2e suite incl. corruption proxy), and the reference CLI (`cli/`, PRs #19–#20)
passed all five phase-2 manual gates — its `-debug`/`-timeout` output and
sentinel exit codes are the ready instrument for phase 3's manual gates.
Deliberate seams already in place for this phase: `oci.StatusError` for retry
classification and transfer's read-vs-write error tagging.

Plan (from PLAN.md phase 3): retry decision logic in the core with injected
sleep (clock-free tests); adapter maps HTTP failures to typed errors so the
core decides retryable vs. terminal without seeing HTTP; failure injection at
the mock layer (dropped connections mid-part, 429 + Retry-After, 500s,
out-of-order completion); e2e through toxiproxy killing connections
mid-transfer. Gates: three manual (toxiproxy ride-through, zot restart
mid-push, dead-port fail-fast) plus automated backoff/decision matrix and
flaky-network e2e.
